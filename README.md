A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects Claude to Spotify, allowing you to control your music directly from conversations.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Get Spotify API Credentials

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Set the redirect URI to: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback`
4. Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Install the Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/varunneal/spotify-mcp.git
cd spotify-mcp
```

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spotify": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/spotify-mcp",
        "run",
        "spotify-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
        "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret_here",
        "SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. First Time Setup

1. **Restart Claude Desktop**
2. **Start a conversation** and say: *"Check my Spotify authentication status"*
3. **Follow the prompts** to authenticate (one-time setup)
4. **Start using Spotify commands!**

## üí¨ Example Conversations

```
You: "Play some jazz music"
Claude: [Searches for jazz, starts playing]

You: "What's currently playing?"
Claude: [Shows current track info]

You: "Add this to my favorites playlist"
Claude: [Adds current track to specified playlist]

You: "Skip to the next song"
Claude: [Skips track]
```

## üîß Requirements

- **Spotify Premium** (required for playback control)
- **Python 3.12+**
- **uv** package manager
- **Claude Desktop**

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Testing

Test your setup before using with Claude:

```bash
# Test authentication and basic functionality
python test_auth.py

# If you need to authenticate, run with the code:
python test_auth.py YOUR_AUTH_CODE_HERE
```

## üîç Debugging

### Common Issues

**"No active device"**: Open Spotify on any device (phone, computer, etc.)

**"Authentication failed"**: Use the Authentication tool to get a new auth URL

**"Permission denied"**: Make sure you have Spotify Premium

### Logs

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
- **Windows**: Check Claude Desktop logs
- **Debug mode**: Use MCP Inspector:
  ```bash
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/spotify-mcp run spotify-mcp
  ```

## üéµ Available Commands

The server automatically handles all Spotify operations through natural conversation. You can:

- Control playback (play, pause, skip, volume)
- Search for any music content
- Manage your queue
- Work with playlists
- Get information about tracks/artists/albums
- Check what's currently playing

## üîê Privacy & Security

- **Tokens are cached locally** and refreshed automatically
- **No data is stored** beyond what's needed for authentication
- **Standard OAuth2 flow** - same as any Spotify app
- **Revoke access anytime** in your Spotify account settings
